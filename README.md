My Portfolio as a Data Analyst — Ishmal Khan.

Preview locally:

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

To deploy to GitHub Pages automatically:

1. Ensure this repository is pushed to a GitHub repo.
2. The workflow `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` will deploy `main` to the `gh-pages` branch on every push.
3. In the repository Settings → Pages, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (if needed). The site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

If you'd like, I can push the final commits and enable deployment to the existing remote `origin` — tell me to proceed and confirm you want to use the current `origin` remote (`https://github.com/ShaguftaPathan/Portfolio_Website.git`) or provide a different repo URL.
